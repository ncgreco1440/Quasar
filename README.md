# Quasar  

A framework for web applications based in PHP. Quasar handles it's Model and Controllers server side while only the View is client side, yet even that is generated by server side code. Even wthout the use of Symphony or Composer anyone can grab any third party PHP library and slide it into any of the directories within **lib/**, and so long as you follow the naming convention per directory autoload.php will take care of the rest.  

Quasar has a built in **/admin** section for a CMS and a public section for all views that are open for the public to view.  

Quasar has three standard webpages set up by default: _Home_, _About_, and _Contact_.
